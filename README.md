### What?
Small script that returns a random Chuck Norris quote.

I've created a python and a bash version.

### How?

Pretty straight forward:

Python
------
```
	$ python quotes.py
```

Bash
----
```
	$ ./quotes.sh
```

### API
Also there is a [server version](https://github.com/patillacode/randomchuck)

If you have any other nice quotes add them at the `quotes.txt` file and that is it.
